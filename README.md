## About Me 💁🏻

Hi, I'm Jessica! I'm a 3rd year computational statistics undergraduate student. This summer, I will be interning at KPMG as an advisory intern. My academic interests currently include working on strengthinging my programming skills for data science, working with categorical data, and learning more about nutrition. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, exchanging puns, eating delicious food (especially sweets), learning new trivia, and sleeping. I also recently rediscovered an interest in baking.

## Projects

### STA 141B - Data & Web Technologies for Data Analysis

#### [Final Project 🔥](STA141B/final.html)

My teammates and I did a study on young people. We decided to put a spin on our project and think of it as a consulting project where we take our data, draw conclusions from it, and advise a client on how to utilize our conclusions. For our purposes, we will be advising an advertising client on the spending habits of subjects from our dataset.
