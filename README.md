## About Me

Hi, I'm Jessica! I'm a 3rd year computational statistics undergraduate student. I will be starting as an undergraduate researcher under UC Davis Computer Science Professor Norman Matloff during the Spring 2017 quarter. This summer, I will be interning at KPMG as an advisory intern. My academic interests currently include working on strengthinging my programming skills for data science, working with categorical data, and learning more about nutrition. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling, exchanging puns, learning new trivia, eating delicious food, and sleeping. I also recently rediscovered an interest in baking. 
Thanks for visiting my site!
