## About Me 💁🏻

Hi, I'm Jessica! I'm a 3rd year computational statistics undergraduate student. I will be starting as an undergraduate researcher under UC Davis Computer Science Professor Norman Matloff during the Spring 2017 quarter. This summer, I will be interning at KPMG as an advisory intern. My academic interests currently include working on strengthinging my programming skills for data science, working with categorical data, and learning more about nutrition. In my spare time, I enjoy traveling🌏 , exchanging puns 😂, eating delicious food 🍜, learning new trivia 🤓, and sleeping 😴. I also recently rediscovered an interest in baking 🍪. 
Thanks for visiting my site!


## Projects

### STA 141B - Data & Web Technologies for Data Analysis

#### [Playing With A Cat Image 😻](STA141B/Assignment2/)

In this assignment, I converted an image of a cat into any array and swapped color channels of the image. I then used singular value decompsition to see what the smallest number of terms was where the cat is still recognizable as a cat. 

#### [Food Nutrients 🍎](STA141B/Assignment4/)

In this assignment, I wrote a funciton that searched for foods from a given dataset in the USDA Food Composition Databases. I then created a dataframe to store information on the given foods created plots and to decide which foods provide the best combination of price, yield, and nutrition with kcals as a measure of "nutrition.

#### [Final Project 🔥](STA141B/FinalProject/)

My teammates and I did a study on young people. We decided to put a spin on our project and think of it as a consulting project where we take our data, draw conclusions from it, and advise a client on how to utilize our conclusions. For our purposes, we will be advising an advertising client on the spending habits of subjects from our dataset.
